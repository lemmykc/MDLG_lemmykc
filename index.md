# Liam Carroll

## Who am I
My name is Liam Carroll and I am currently completing a Masters of Mathematics at The University of Melbourne, majoring in Applied Mathematics, but trying to become a jack of all trades and master of none by doing pure mathematics and statistics, too. I am completing the research component of my degree primarily under the supervision of [Dr Daniel Murfet](http://therisingsea.org) as part of the [Melbourne Deep Learning Group](http://mdlg.ai). I also tutor first year mathematics such as Calculus 1 and Calculus 2 at Melbourne University. When I am not thinking about maths I am probably in a concert hall or on top of a mountain.

## Current work
The topic of my upcoming thesis is Phase Transitions in ReLU Neural Networks, in which I have demonstrated the existence of phase transitions in small ReLU networks using the theoretical grounding of Sumio Watanabe's Singular Learning Theory. 

You can read [Draft 0.5](Chopped_thesis_website.pdf) of this thesis, but be warned, this is quite incomplete. You probably shouldn't read it. But I'll be sure to upload the real version on October 8th 2021. 


## Anything else? 
Dan told me to make this website. So, _insert immortal words of Paul Roos [here](https://youtu.be/Da8qFbg3XZg)_.
